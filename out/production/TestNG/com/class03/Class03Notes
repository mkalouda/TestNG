Assertions
-- Hard assertion
    - if assertions found an error, our code is stuck there and will not allow execute the remaining code
-- Soft assertion
    - it allows us to execute our entire code and gives result of all the failures in the end of the execution

-- We use assertAll() to collect all the failure at the end
